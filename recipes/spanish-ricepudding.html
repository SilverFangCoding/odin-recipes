                    <li>Take a <strong>sauce pan</strong> and add the <strong>milk</strong>, the <strong>sugar</strong>, 
                        the <strong>cinnamon</strong> and the <strong>lemon peels</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Wash the <strong>rice</strong> with running water to get rid of the starch or most of it.</li>
                    <li>Add the <strong>rice</strong> to the pan and heat all up at low fire (Make sure you stir it frequently 
                        to don't burn the milk on the bottom).</li>
                    <li>Let the mixture boil for a good amount of time (Remember to stir every 4-5 minutes) until 
                        it reduce to de desire level of creaminess (Normally mine one is around 40mins).</li>
                    <li>When ready just separate in portions and let it cool down to room temperature. </li> 
                    <p>(Some people like to remove now the <strong>lemon peels</strong>, some people like to eat it with them, 
                        you need to decide now and remove them if so)</p>
                    <li>Grate some of the <strong>cinnamon</strong> on top and place in the fridge to chill.</li>
                    <li>Grab a spoon and enjoy!</li>
